# Fantastic Four Emb(race) Challenge Solution

## Summary
As a team, we decided to take on the Emb(race) challenge to create a technological solution for tackling problems of social inequality and injustice that occur in our country. Like with all controversial problems, the first step into attacking the problem is to acknowledge and address the problem, and many of our colleagues and peers have taken the initiative action in trying to spread the word and educate people using social platforms like Instagram and Twitter. We love to see these actions taken, but when an abundance of information and things you can do are given from several different outlets, it can be overwhelming making it hard to decide and actually take action. Therefore, our team decided to make a platform that would take care of all of that consolidating it down to 4 main sections: I want to get help, I want to donate, I want to make a difference, and I want to be more informed.  

One of the main goals of the “Get Help” section is to provide individuals a platform to create petitions that they can use to enact change in their communities. Users will be able to download a copy of the petition as well as a list of all the individuals that have signed it. Another feature of this section is to supply resources to where users can get legal help from depending on which state they live in. When a user selects their state, they will be directed to the corresponding American Bar Association sponsored website for their state. They have lots of advice on how to get legal help and also include a “find a lawyer” tool. 

In the “I want to donate” section, users can choose from an abundance of organizations that help fight social inequality and injustice in their own way. We provide a description of what the organization stands for and what they fight against, so that users can choose what specific area they want to donate to.  

In the “I want to make a difference” section, users can view and add events. When the user clicks on View Event button, a list of current events will be displayed. The displayed events are coming from the cloud database. When the user clicks on Add Event button, the user will be presented a form to fill out. If successful, the event will be added to the cloud database. The goal of this section to spread awareness of the events happening around the user. This will also help the organizer bring more people in. 

In the “I want to be more informed” section, users can look at current articles about what’s going on in our country related to social inequality and injustice. They can choose between looking at news sources with a more liberal take on a topic versus a more conservative take on the topic, so that they can develop their own bias about the situation as a whole.  

In conclusion, we made this solution as an easier way to transport information to people and consolidate that information into one platform. It is a way to make being proactive less overwhelming and easier to process. Rather than putting several links and articles onto their social media page, users can put a shoutout of one link for people to click on that’ll do everything they are trying to make known for them.
